        <p>I help residents of Dyker Heights and Bay Ridge with a wide range of every day tasks including household cleanings, deliveries, home maintenance, automobile maintenance, and even custom requests! I'm not an in-and-out, all about the money guy - I believe it is important to establish a relationship with customers based on trust and mutual respect. I've lived in Dyker Heights for 25 years so I don't see these jobs as tasks to get done just to get paid; I see my job as a way to give back to my community that I know and love. I'm a regular guy from the neighborhood, here to lend a helping hand.</p>
